Git is a version control system. That means it helps you track changes in files, usually code, and collaborate with others on software development projects.

🧠 Why Use Git?

✅ Track history – Every change is saved so you can go back to previous versions.

✅ Collaboration – Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.

✅ Branching – You can try out new features or fixes without affecting the main code.

✅ Open-source – It’s free and widely used in the software industry.
